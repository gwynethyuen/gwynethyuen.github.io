        <strong>About Me:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I am an undergraduate student in my third year at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute working towards a B.S. in Computer Science as well as a B.S. in Electronic Arts. As a student-athlete on the varsity swim team, I find myself excelling at skills that most students struggle to master, such as time management. Although most of my time is committed towards managing classes, practices, homework, and meets, I always find the time to explore my interests and do things that excite me. In my free time, I enjoy creating videos and photos in an attempt make an impact on the world.

          As a child, I was always interested in how things work and why they work a certain way but as I grew older I was even more interested in how things work on the internet and electronic devices. How can we use social media and the internet not only to share information but also to express our opinions and beliefs? How can we use it to get a message across? These kinds of questions intrigued me and I wanted to learn how to use the internet to influence people as well as
          how the behind-the-scenes portion of it works - hence the two different majors I am studying.
